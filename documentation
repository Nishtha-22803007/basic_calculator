Print	“a welcome message and lines in brief to define the application.”
Make a while loop to make the program running until the user chooses to exit after each operation.
Define some variables.
Take an expression from user to calculate as a string.
Check the validity of the expression as it doesn’t have characters except numbers and (-, +, /or*), if that didn’t achieve print a warning message and take another expression from the user.
Turn the expression into numbers and operators in the form [numerator1/denominator1 (-, +, /or*) numerator2/ denominator2] as numerator1, denominator1, numerator2 and denominator2 are integers positive or negative.

If operation is /, do the following lines:

        o	Check if denominator1, numerator2 or denominator2 is zero, and if this happened, print a warning message and take another expression from the user.
        o	The result of the expression will be (numerator1*denominator2)/ (denominator1*numerator2).


If operation is *, do the following lines:

        o	Check if denominator1 or denominator2 is zero, and if this happened, print a warning message and take another expression from the user.
        o	The result of the expression will be (numerator1* numerator2)/ (denominator1* denominator2).


If operation is +, do the following lines:

        o	Check if denominator1 or denominator2 is zero, and if this happened, print a warning message and take another expression from the user.
        o	The result of the expression will be ((numerator1* denominator2) + (numerator2 * denominator1)) / (denominator1* denominator2).


If operation is -, do the following lines:

        o	Check if denominator1 or denominator2 is zero, and if this happened, print a warning message and take another expression from the user.
        o	The result of the expression will be ((numerator1* denominator2) - (numerator2 * denominator1)) / (denominator1* denominator2).
